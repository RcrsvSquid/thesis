\end{center}
Speech disfluencies are common in human discourse. It has been shown that speech
disfluencies negatively affect comprehension \citep{corelystewart}.“Pitchback”,
is a web application that employs speech recognition, natural language
processing, and audio analysis to programmatically provide feedback for improved
speech patterns and communication style. Our microservice based architecture
runs feedback computations in parallel providing the user with near real time
results. We have shown that this method for providing automated feedback is
helpful to users preparing for public speaking events.
